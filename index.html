                <h2>1. A Single Inch of Water Can Cause Over $25,000 in Damage</h2>
                <p>
                    You read that right. Just <a href="https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance#:~:text=Floods%20can%20happen%20anywhere%20%E2%80%94%20just,does%20not%20cover%20flood%20damage."><u>one measly inch of water is enough to wreak financial havoc</u></a>. Imagine an overflowing bathtub or a minor flood—it doesn’t look like much, but water can quickly damage flooring, drywall, furniture, and even your electrical system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here in San Antonio, where sudden storms can pop up out of nowhere, this stat should hit close to home. A little preparation can go a long way, like checking for low spots in your yard or making sure your gutters are clear.
                </p>
                <h2>2. Water Damage Is the Leading Cause of Home Insurance Claims</h2>
                <p>
                    We’re not talking about the occasional burst pipe—<a href="https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-homeowners-and-renters-insurance"><u>water damage accounts for more claims</u></a>  than fire, theft, or any other disaster. And while insurance might help cover costs, dealing with adjusters and paperwork is no one’s idea of fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pro tip: Take the time to review your policy now. Do you know what’s covered? Does it include flood damage? If not, you might want to consider supplemental flood insurance. And remember, we’re just a call away if you ever need help navigating the cleanup process.
                </p>
                <h2>3. 93% of Water Damage Cases Are Preventable</h2>
                <p>
                    This stat stings a little, doesn’t it? The truth is, <a href="https://www.chartwellins.com/blog/the-case-for-installing-water-shutoff-devices.aspx"><u>most water damage can be avoided</u></a> with regular maintenance and a little attention to detail. Leaky pipes, clogged gutters, and unsealed windows are all common culprits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of your home like a car—if you ignore the check engine light, you’re asking for trouble. Take a few hours every season to inspect for potential problems. Trust us, future you will thank you.
                </p>
                <h2>4. Mold Can Begin Growing in Just 24–48 Hours After Water Damage</h2>
                <p>
                    Water damage doesn’t just stop with the puddles. If left untreated, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/mold/brief-guide-mold-moisture-and-your-home">mold can start growing</a> faster than weeds in a summer yard. And once it’s there, it’s not just a nuisance; it’s a health hazard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here’s the kicker: even a tiny leak behind your dishwasher or a damp corner of your basement can lead to mold. The moment you notice water damage, give us a call. Our team specializes in mold prevention and remediation, so you can breathe easy—literally.
                </p>
                <h2>5. 40% of Homeowners Have Experienced Water Damage</h2>
                <p>
                    If you think water damage is something that only happens to other people, think again. <a href="https://news.chubb.com/2022-04-28-New-Chubb-Survey-Measures-Ownership-Behaviors-and-Attitudes-of-U-S-and-Canadian-Homeowners-and-Renters"><u>Nearly half of all homeowners</u></a> will deal with it at some point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’ve seen it all here in San Antonio, from flash flood disasters to slow leaks that quietly destroy homes over years. It’s not about if water damage will happen—it’s about being ready when it does.
                </p>
                <h2>6. Washing Machines Are Responsible for 50% of Water Damage Insurance Claims</h2>
                <p>
                    Your trusty washing machine might be doing more than just cleaning your clothes. Faulty hoses, overloading, or old appliances are often to blame for water damage claims.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A quick tip: Replace your washing machine hoses every 3–5 years, and don’t leave the house with a load running. It’s a simple fix that can save you a massive headache later.
                </p>
                <h2>7. 90% of Basements Will Experience Water Damage at Some Point</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://krapflegal.com/recources/water-damage/water-damage-statistics-key-insights-and-trends-for-homeowners/"><u>Basements are basically water magnets</u></a>. Whether it’s from heavy rains, poor drainage, or plumbing issues, most basements will face water damage eventually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’ve got a basement here in San Antonio, consider waterproofing it or installing a sump pump. Think of it as an investment in peace of mind—you’ll sleep better knowing your space is protected.
                </p>
                <h2>8. Slow Leaks Account for 11,000 Gallons of Water Wasted Annually</h2>
                <p>
                    That’s enough water to fill a swimming pool! <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/fix-leak-week#:~:text=The%20average%20household's%20leaks%20can,faucets%2C%20and%20other%20leaking%20valves."><u>Slow leaks aren’t just sneaky; they’re wasteful</u></a>. They drive up your water bill and slowly erode your home’s foundation or flooring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Check for signs of leaks, like unexplained spikes in your water bill or tiny stains on your ceiling. If you’re not sure where the water is coming from, don’t worry—we’re experts at finding and fixing hidden leaks.
                </p>
                <h2>9. Flood Damage Costs Homeowners an Average of $69,000 Per Incident</h2>
                <p>
                    Floods don’t mess around. Between structural damage, ruined belongings, and mold remediation, <a href="https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance#:~:text=The%20National%20Flood%20Insurance%20Program,socio%2Deconomic%20impact%20of%20floods.&text=The%20National%20Flood%20Insurance%20Program%20(NFIP)%20is%20managed%20by%20the,a%20policy%20visit%20FloodSmart.gov."><u>the costs can skyrocket</u></a>. And here in Texas, flooding is a real concern, even if you’re not in a high-risk zone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the rain won’t stop, remember: we’re just a call away. Our team responds within 30 minutes to get the water out and start the drying process before the damage gets worse.
                </p>
                <h2>10. The Risk of Water Damage Increases by 37% in Older Homes</h2>
                <p>
                    Do you live in one of San Antonio’s charming older homes? While they’re full of character, they’re also more prone to water damage. Aging pipes, worn-out roofing, and outdated appliances all increase your risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your home is more “vintage” than “new build,” consider scheduling a professional inspection. It’s better to catch small issues before they turn into big, expensive problems.
